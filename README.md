This is `ytree`, a [yt](https://github.com/yt-project/yt) extension for
working with tree data and especially merger trees.

Generally speaking, tree data defines a one-directional relationship
between a series of objects. In trees, objects can have one or more
ancestors, but only a single descendent.

Structure formation in cosmology proceeds in a hierarchical fashion,
where dark matter halos grow via mergers with other halos. This type
of evolution can be conceptualized as a tree, with small branches
connecting to successively larger ones, and finally to the trunk. A
merger tree describes the growth of halos in a cosmological
simulation by linking a halo appearing in a given snapshot to its
direct ancestors in a previous snapshot and its descendent in the next
snapshot.

Merger trees are computationally expensive to generate and a great
number of codes exist for computing them. However, each of these codes
saves the resulting data to a different format. `ytree` is Python
package for reading and working with merger tree data from multiple
formats. If you are already familiar with using
[yt](https://github.com/yt-project/yt) to analyze snapshots from
cosmological simulations, then think of `ytree` as the `yt` of merger
trees.

To load a merger tree data set with `ytree` and print the masses of
all the halos in a single tree, one could do:

```
>>> import ytree
>>> a = ytree.load('tree_0_0_0.dat')
>>> my_tree = a[0]
>>> print(my_tree['tree', 'mass'].to('Msun'))
[6.57410072e+14 6.57410072e+14 6.53956835e+14 6.50071942e+14 ...
 2.60575540e+12 2.17122302e+12 2.17122302e+12] Msun
```

A list of all currently supported formats can be found in the online
[documentation](https://ytree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Arbor.html#loading-merger-tree-data). If
you would like to see support added for another format, we would be
happy to work with you to make it happen. In principle, any type of
tree-like data where an object has one or more ancestors and a single
descendent can be supported.

## Installation

`ytree` can be installed with pip or conda:

### pip installation

```
pip install ytree
```

### conda installation

```
conda install -c conda-forge ytree
```

### source installation

To get the development version, clone this repository and install like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/ytree-project/ytree
cd ytree
pip install -e .
```

## Getting Started

The [ytree documentation](https://ytree.readthedocs.io) will walk you
through installation, get you started analyzing merger trees, and help
you become a contributor to the project. Have a look!

## Sample Data

Sample data for all merger tree formats supported by `ytree` is available on the
[yt Hub](https://girder.hub.yt/) in the
[ytree data](https://girder.hub.yt/#collection/59835a1ee2a67400016a2cda) collection.

## Contributing

`ytree` would be much better with your contribution!  As an extension of
[the yt Project](https://yt-project.org/), we follow the yt
[guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/yt-project/yt#contributing).
