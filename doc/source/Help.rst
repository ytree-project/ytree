Help
====

If you encounter problems, we want to help and there are lots
of places to get help.  As an extension of `the yt project
<https://yt-project.org/>`_, we are members of the yt community.
Any questions regarding ``ytree`` can be posted to the `yt users list
<https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/yt-users.python.org>`__.
You will also find interactive help on the `yt slack channel
<https://yt-project.org/docs/dev/help/index.html#go-on-slack-or-irc-to-ask-a-question>`__.

Bugs and feature requests can also be posted on the `ytree issues
page <https://github.com/ytree-project/ytree/issues>`__.

See you out there!
